# CodeX

CodeX is a platform which converts code into easy to understand language.


## Project Description
Sometimes we write some code or we copy the code from some resource but we can’t interpret the working/logic behind the code. While writing the code when we get stuck in some problem, we directly redirect to stackoverflow or github but from there we don’t get in depth knowledge about the code. To solve the particular problem we have decided to build a website to interpret the complex code easily. Through this website, we are targeting to deliver comprehensive analysis of the code with the help of machine learning. With the help of machine learning we are planning to add automatic generation of pseudo code based on the user's input. The automatic generated pseudo code will act as a blueprint and will help our users to understand the code better. Apart from this we have given automatic flow chart generation feature  time complexity of the code on the server side because time complexity pla.
